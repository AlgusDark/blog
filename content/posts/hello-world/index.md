## Once again, to write

I love writing and reading, but I don't have the time to do both. I have postponed too
much time to write again, and I think that has done me a little damage since I have
lost the practice.

I've decided that it's a good time to learn new things and keep a blog about it. Maybe
the mistake that I had before was that I was first doing this for an audience and it did
not include me in it, so this time I intend to write mainly for myself and in response
to some questions that I frequently answer to other people.

So, dear reader, if you know me you will know about the things that are of my interest
and maybe not all of this is of your interest, but I hope that some of this is
interesting to you as it is for me.

## Made with Gatsby

I've made the blog with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), a framework written in
**React** to create static sites. Previously I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
written in **ruby**, with which I felt quite comfortable working but it was difficult
to customize since my specialty is with  **JavaScript**  so I did not venture to make
such drastic changes in the engine, which I will change with _Gatsby_ and which I've'
already started doing now.

Their documentation is amazing but I ventured without reading it because I wanted to
experience first hand if it was complicated to understand their tools. It was a pleasant
surprise that in version 2 
(_before I had tried with v1 and it was not a pleasant experience_)
everything was so simple or at least it was easy to debug and find the problems.

Another reason for why I did wanted to play with _Gatsby_ was that it uses
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), another technology that is pretty popular nowadays and
wich I had only read about it. I just can say... **WOW**. Maybe isn't the definitive
solution to all of our problems, but it's a good answer to the Front End's world.

## Location
Another reason of why I wanted to write again was the fact that I want to improve my
english, so I wrote a little script to have
[localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization).
_Gatsby_ already has some [i18n packages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/localization-i18n/)
to make this, but I had some troubles when I wanted to implement it because I changed
from **markdown** to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for my posts. So I can tell you that
if you know _JavaScript_, customizing it will be a piece of cake.

## What's this all about?
As I mentioned before, I'll try to write from diverse of topics, so I'll not only talk
about technology because it's not the only topic I usually talk about. Another thing I
decided was not to add a comment section in each post and pass all those conversations
to social networks like _Facebook_ or [Twitter](https://tw.algus.ninja).

So let's start with this story.
