*Well, now I did take a weight off my shoulders*

Since I was very young I have been, as my family and friends describe me, a good eater. I'm always open to any kind of food. Trying something new is an explosion of flavors that makes each bite a great experience.

Bottom line: my stomach was happy.

I discovered that the end of the stories where everyone lives happily ever after does not apply in the real life and I began to have health problems due to my obesity.

Bending over, walking, standing or the simple fact of being alive were taking a lot of effort from me to keep doing these activities.

*I had to do something*.

Have you ever seen the **Batman Returns** movie? In that movie the penguin appears, played by **Danny DeVito**. Well, I remembered it when I saw my reflection of a building while happily walking.

That day was very shocking for me. Having that image in my brain was the detonation for me to say:

*It's time to change*.

I bought a scale to check the horror with scientific data.

I held my breath.

Scared I put my feet on the scale while maintaining my eyes closed, waiting for the numbers to stop counting up.

**99 Kilograms**.

A terrible number under these circumstances.

And that's how it all started.

## The first days

I started walking after work. However, the problems of [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) caused me to quickly cease my activities. No gyms and no outdoor exercise.

I remembered that I had bought the [RingFit Adventure](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ring-fit-adventure-switch/) game for the Nintendo Switch.

I also remembered how tired was to me playing the game, reason for why I dropped it on the second day.

Well, my determination was different. I started playing it from **Monday to Friday**. 1 hour in the morning, before work. 1 hour in the afternoon, after work.

I was never able to lose weight in the gyms I attended. It usually never took me more than 3 months to chose stop going. The truth is that I did not see huge changes.

For that reason, my goal was set to lose 1 kilogram per month.

## The first month

I had never thought that I was eating too much. White rice is the main accompaniment in Japanese meals, just as tortillas is in Mexico. And, of course, the second or third servings wre not lacking at my home.

I decided to lower my food intake. I also started listening to my body. Who'd say? It isn't normal not to be able to move after eating.

I said goodbye to the bread, the sodas and the fried foods. The truth is that I only felt bad of not eating bread since we had a very long friendship.

*4 weeks*.

*The moment of truth*.

By this stage I already had my defined routine. I was feeling great playing "RingFit Adventure" and I was fully confident that my body was saying goodbye to 1 kilogram. So I faced the boss of this level.

*Breath deeply*

I went up without fear and stayed looking at the landscape through the window of my room while the numbers were running against the time.

**95 Kilograms**.

<p style="font-size:2.5rem">ðŸ˜± What?</p>

I was very confident that in 1 month I would be losing 1 kilogram. But the numbers don't lie. I had lost 4 kilograms. 1 kilogram per week.

I researched about it on varios websites and with my friends:

> A healthy weight loss is about 500 to 1000 grams per week.

My motivation started to grow and I kept going.

## The next step

My exercise consisted of simple exercises thanks to the help of RingFit. I needed something more to reaffirm all the mass that I would be losing. I was afraid of having a lot of loose skin.

It's funny but I've always owned a pair of dumbbells but never used them in my life. I can easily remember 4 pairs of dumbbells that I had to give away or sell since I never put them to use. But now I was someone different.

I found a very interesting page where they share various workout plans. That's where I downloaded [a dumbbell-only plan](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/dumbbell-only-home-or-gym-fullbody-workout.html) that I followed for the next several weeks. For this I had to invest in a [training bench](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01M9D4AAW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

I did different experiments over the course of several weeks.

I added bread to my meals (*I really love sandwiches*) and I could afford to eat sweat bread some weekends. My weight loss started to vary but it never was less than 500 grams per week.

I also stopped exercising in the afternoons and I was only doing it in the mornings.

I stopped using the elevator. Even in these difficult times due to the pandemic we need to get food. The elevator is a confined space where social distancing cannot be applied. Taking the stairs helped me get around and avoid people. Wow, nobody uses stairs anymore.

## The result

My story started with 99 kilograms. I was able to cosplay the **heavy breathing** cat.

Today I am very happy with my **80 kilograms**.

I don't play RingFit that often but I like to [share my stats on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23RingFitAdventure)%20(from%3AAlgusDark)&src=typed_query) to motivate me to keep doing it. Currently I have more than 32 hours of exercise. I say exercise because when playing 1 hour, between dialogues and other options, only about 25 to 30 minutes are really exercise.

## The learning

It wasn't an easy journey but it was one that I've enjoyed and I'm still doing it. It is very curious how many of my problems disappeared. Living with obesity for most of my life made me to realizar that my problems were not normal.

My advice is:

- Find the ideal time to exercise.
  
  If you think you don't have time, find a way to create more. I started waking up at *6:30 am* for it. It was difficult at first, but today I'm very happy and satisfied with the results. I'll write more about this topic in the future.

- Set a goal.
  
  My goal was very small and achievable. I cannot say that it was simple because anything could happened. However, based on my previous experience, I decided it was the right fit for me. Find your goal.

- Listen to your body.
  
  Although I didn't do any diet as such, simply reducing my daily intake improved my health. I researched the consumption and burning of calories. I tried keeping a calory diary but it was difficult for me to keep it update. For this I opted to make it rigorously for a week and apply a mental estimate in the following weeks. It is always good to experiment.

- Align the exercise with your hobbies.
  
  It will sound very strange, but playing RingFit made me realize how much fun exercising was. Leveling up is a wonderful experience as there is progress in your work. Best of all, it was reflected in real life. It's like playing an [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) with experience points to assign and create the *build* that you like the best.

## At the end...

It only remains to say that it has been time to buy new clothes.

To make extra holes in my belts.

Of cosplay with sagging pants in the cholo style.

But more than anything...

*It's been good times*
