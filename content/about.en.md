title: About me

I'm a Geek, technology and literature lover. I touched a computer at age 13 and the heat of the screen hypnotized me.

I love entrepreneurship, which has helped me to boost each of my  ideas; some successfully and others in a failure, but from all of them I learned a lot. The video games have been an important part in my life, thanks to *"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past"* my interest in English was born and I decided to learn it by myself.

 I am an enthusiast and dreamer, my favorite hobby is learning. In short, I am that guy who dances on the street while walking, writes in the sky and composes music, with a game boy, to the moon.
